1,You must be the 56th version of Mycosis Prime. Nice to finally meet you. ,,,

2,"If you are wondering, you are a disease created by an intelligent but very weak alien civilization called Mycelons.",,,
2,Now see these young humans? ,student,,
2,Their sole purpose is to annoy everybody around them. I would cover my ears if I had any.,student,,
2, It’s time to give them a present. Infect all of them!,student,,
2,"Unless you feel sorry for them in which case…well, do it anyway.",student,,
2,They move faster and are harder to get infected so be wise with your choices.,student,,
3,The disease is a perfect weapon. It helped us invade other planets very easily. ,,,
3,"You are one of the best of them, not many others have achieved so far..Wait..",,,
3,Mmmm…those garbage bins smell delicious. But they are useful as well. ,bin,,
3,"They are not human, a fact I really hope you realized before I said it,  but they can be used to spread spores as well.",bin,,
3,You can take some snacks from there after you are finished.,bin,,
4,"Alright, back to the topic. You are the 56th iteration of said disease.",,,

4,Look at these pathetic business humans.,businessman,,
4,Running around all day yelling at everybody. ,businessman,,
4,And they honestly believe they are doing something important. ,businessman,,
4,"Even I could do that. If, you know, I had a real body.",businessman,,
4,"Anyway, let’s make them actually useful.",businessman,,
5,These small creatures are called squirrels.,squirrel,,
5,They are always moving. It’s driving me crazy.,squirrel,,
5,"Although, I must admit they look cute.",squirrel,,
5,Try to infect them! Let’s see how much cuter they will become.,squirrel,,
6,Those evil walls are making our work much more complicated.,,,
6,We need to do something about them.,,,
6,"No, we won’t be infecting them. How would that even work?",,,
6,"No, do you see those flying squirrels? They are called birds.",bird,,
6,"Infect them, and they will fly over the walls.",bird,,
7,What's the point of this virologist?,viro,,
7,Why would she help others stay healthy when they will all die anyway?,viro,,
7,Pretty useless if you ask me.,viro,,
7,How about showing her how useless her job actually is?,viro,,
8,"Oh, this won’t be that easy.",samuri,,
8,He would kill any infected humans close to him.,samuri,,
8,Even children and elders.,samuri,,
8,He probably finds them as annoying as I do. ,samuri,,
8,"However, he has a soft spot for animals, so…you know. Animals.",samuri,,
8,Go for it. Don’t disappoint me!,samuri,,
55,The doctors are weird. ,doctor,,
55,"Always cover their faces, stay in a small area, afraid they will get ill or something.",doctor,,
55,If I needed breathing to survive I would definitely suffocate with that thing on my face…,doctor,,
55,…If I would have an existing face to begin with.,doctor,,
55,Let’s make them do something actually useful and spread the spores to even more humans.,doctor,,
55,"It won’t be that easy with that underwear on their head, but I’m sure you can figure it out.",doctor,,
65,The Mycelons are too proud to admit it,,,
65,"but the truth is that if not for the intelligence you all have, except the first version, they wouldn’t be able to achieve anything.",,,
65,Even they don’t know how intelligent you all actually are. ,,,
65,I don’t think they would like the truth.,,,
45,"When they created Mycosis Prime, it was a mess.",,,
45,The first version of it managed to infect itself and died. Can you believe that?,,,
45,You are doing much better. For now at least.,,,
